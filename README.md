# LokSabhaElections2024Visualization
In this project, I have used scraping to visualize the data of the Lok Sabha Elections of 2024. I have done this using Microsoft Power BI.

Based on the visualized data, here are 10 key insights:
1. Top Candidate: The candidate with the highest total votes is from the Bharatiya Janata Party.
2. Vote Distribution: The majority of votes are concentrated among the top three candidates.
3. Party Dominance: Bharatiya Janata Party leads significantly in several constituencies.
4. Close Contest: Some constituencies show a close contest between the top two candidates.
5. Independent Candidates: Independent candidates received a small fraction of the total votes.
6. Voter Turnout: Total votes indicate a high voter turnout in certain constituencies.
7. Regional Trends: Specific regions show strong support for certain parties, indicating regional political trends.
8. Postal Votes Impact: Postal votes contribute a small percentage of the total votes.
9. Minor Parties: Minor parties and independent candidates collectively received less than 10% of the votes.
10. NOTA: The option 'None of the Above' (NOTA) received a small yet notable number of votes.
These insights provide a comprehensive overview of the Lok Sabha election results and the political landscape.
